      <description>Testing your code is a crucial practice for every developer. Automated testing ensures that your code works as expected every time it runs. Tests also function as internal documentation, giving a fellow programmer instructions on how to properly execute your classes and methods. While these purposes are the same for C# as any other language, the implementation of tests will look a bit different.&#xA;This course covers unit testing in C# with a test framework called MSTest.</description>

      <description>MSTest is a framework that provides the methods and assertions for writing and executing unit tests in C#.&#xA;C# Attributes In C#, attributes are formalized bits of information about a program. They operate somewhere between actual code syntax and a comment on the code. Attributes do not directly affect the code they annotate, but they do supply information to the compiler. An attribute is enclosed in square brackets, [], and placed above the item it decorates.</description>
