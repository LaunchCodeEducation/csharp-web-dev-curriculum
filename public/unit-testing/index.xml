    <link>http://localhost:1313/unit-testing/index.html</link>
    <description>Learning Objectives After completing this chapter, you should be able to do the following:&#xA;Write unit tests to verify the behavior of methods. Identify proper behaviors for which a test should be written. Know the importance of testing in creating well-functioning code. Use test-driven development to define the behavior of code before writing it, and to ensure that code is properly tested. Using MSTest to create unit tests. Key Terminology As you work through this chapter, you should make note of the terms on the following pages:</description>

      <description>Work on these exercises in your local copy of the csharp-web-dev-exercises repo. You were directed to fork and clone this repo earlier in the book. If you have not done so, do so now.&#xA;Tip Earlier in the chapter, we instantiated an object of the Car class called test_car. Be sure to take note of the values of the make, model, gasTankSize, and milesPerGallon fields! Having a note you can quickly reference of how big the gas tank is will help you decide on values to use in your tests!</description>

      <description>For this studio, you will be writing unit tests to help you find errors in the BalancedBrackets.cs file in the starter code.&#xA;Discuss with your fellow students and IA how the given class should behave. What are some examples of input? What would the desired output be for each input?&#xA;Getting Started Fork and clone the studio repository .&#xA;In Visual Studio, check out your repository.&#xA;Write unit tests to find the errors in BalancedBrackets.</description>
