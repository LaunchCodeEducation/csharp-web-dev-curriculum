    <title>Exercises :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/unit-testing/exercises/index.html</link>
    <description>Work on these exercises in your local copy of the csharp-web-dev-exercises repo. You were directed to fork and clone this repo earlier in the book. If you have not done so, do so now.&#xA;Tip Earlier in the chapter, we instantiated an object of the Car class called test_car. Be sure to take note of the values of the make, model, gasTankSize, and milesPerGallon fields! Having a note you can quickly reference of how big the gas tank is will help you decide on values to use in your tests!</description>
