    <title>Registrations and Logins :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/authentication/reading/registrations-and-logins/index.html</link>
    <description>In order for users to successfully navigate through the application, Identity will handle a number of functions related to both authentication and authorization. For the purposes of this book, we will focus on just two: registering for a new account and logging in.&#xA;Note Razor Class Libraries do not have separate controllers like in the traditional MVC design pattern. The logic that we might be inclined to put in a controller for each of the actions that we look at is actually contained within a Razor page.</description>
