    <title>Hashing Passwords :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/authentication/reading/hashing-passwords/index.html</link>
    <description>Simple authentication allows users to log in to a site with a username and password. To implement authentication, we need to be able to verify that a user’s password is correct. However, you should NEVER store passwords in a database. Seriously. Don’t do it. Ever.&#xA;Storing passwords in a database is incredibly insecure. A hacker may break into the database, gaining access to every user account. Or a deviant employee with access to the database may do the same.</description>
