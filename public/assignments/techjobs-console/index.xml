    <title>Assignment 1: Tech Jobs Console :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/techjobs-console/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction Congratulations! Based on your hard work and strong coding skills, you have been brought on as an apprentice to the LaunchCode Tech Team. You will be paired with a mentor to help you get comfortable and continue learning.&#xA;The Company Team at LaunchCode works with employer partners to match qualified programmers with apprenticeships. They asked for a new tool to be built to help them easily manage data for currently available jobs.</description>

      <description>Before diving in and starting to code, make sure you understand what the code you’ve been given does. Since you’re starting with a functioning—albeit unfinished—program, go ahead and run it to get an idea of how it works. To do this, explore the two projects in the solution. Right-click on the project that contains the TechJobs class and select Run Project.&#xA;Warning The application will run until you force it to quit, re-prompting time after time.</description>

      <description>Implement PrintJobs() When trying out the program, and later when reading the code, you hopefully noticed that there’s some work to do in the PrintJobs() method. As it stands, it currently just prints a message: &#34;PrintJobs is not implemented yet&#34;.&#xA;Complete this method. Print out jobs matching the below format:&#xA;***** position type: Data Scientist / Business Intelligence name: Sr. IT Analyst (Data/BI) employer: Bull Moose Industries location: Saint Louis core competency: Statistical Analysis ***** ***** position type: Web - Back End name: Ruby specialist employer: LaunchCode location: Saint Louis core competency: Javascript *****For the autograding script to correctly grade your code, you’ll need to match this format exactly.</description>

      <description>Complete the FindByValue() Method At this stage, the application will allow users to search a given column of the data for a given string. Your next task is to enable a search that looks for the search term in all of the columns.&#xA;In the JobData class, find the method FindByValue(). This method has been outlined for you but contains none of the code needed to work (leave the LoadData() call as the first line of the method).</description>

      <description>Make Search Methods Case-Insensitive You’ve completed your first two tasks!&#xA;Let’s assume you demonstrated the updated application for the Company Team, and they noticed a feature that could be improved. When searching for jobs with the skill &#34;JavaScript&#34; some results were missing (e.g. the Watchtower Security job on line 31 of the CSV file). The search methods turn out to be case-sensitive, so they treat &#34;JavaScript&#34; and &#34;Javascript&#34; as different strings.</description>

      <description>Sanity Check Before submitting, make sure that your application:&#xA;Prints each field of a job when using search functionality, and when listing all columns. If there are no search results, a descriptive message is displayed. Allows the user to search for a string across all columns. Returns case-insensitive results. Run the autograding tests to ensure that the tests pass. How to Submit To turn in your assignment and get credit, follow the submission instructions.</description>
