    <title>Assignment 3: TechJobs MVC :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/techjobs-mvc/index.html</link>
    <description>Introduction Your first two tasks as an apprentice went well! You, Blake, and Sally built the TechJobs console prototype and then refactored the code to move it to an object-oriented format.&#xA;After demonstrating the prototype for the Company Team at LaunchCode, it received the green light to be fully built out as a web application.&#xA;The first step in this process will be to quickly develop a minimum viable product , or MVP.</description>

      <title>Task 1: Review the Starter Code</title>

      <description>Tip One essential programming skill that you will develop is the ability to read and understand someone else’s code. This assignment begins with you practicing exactly that. Make sure you carefully examine the provided code BEFORE you start changing things.&#xA;Trying to “fix” a code sample before understanding how it works leads to confusion, frustration, and a broken program. DO NOT SKIP the code review!&#xA;Carly created a ASP.NET MVC application and filled in some features.</description>

      <title>Task 2: Complete ListController</title>

      <description>Complete the Jobs() action method in ListController. Right now, it returns a view, but we need to send some details about jobs to that view.&#xA;The view relies on ViewBag.jobs, so to start create a list in the action method called jobs. If the user selects “View All”, you should use JobData.FindAll() to populate jobs with all the jobs and update ViewBag.title. If the user selects something specific, you should use JobData.</description>

      <description>Add a Results() action method to SearchController:&#xA;The Results() method should take in two parameters. Both parameters must be strings and the first one should be called “searchType” and the second one should be called “searchTerm”. First, you need to create a local variable called “jobs” that is of type List&lt;Job&gt;. If the user enters “all” in the search box, or if they leave the box empty, call the FindAll() method from JobData.</description>

      <title>Task 4: Display Search Results</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/techjobs-mvc/task-four/index.html</link>

      <description>Note Before starting this task, un-comment out the tests in TestTaskFour.&#xA;Once you have your Results() action method passing information to the view, you need to display the data.&#xA;In Index.cshtml, create a loop to display each job passed in from the controller. Put the job results into a set of tables, similar to what you did for the List/Jobs.cshtml view. Run the tests in TestTaskFour to make sure that you have passed everything properly to the view!</description>

      <title>Task 5: Submit Your Code and Bonus Missions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/techjobs-mvc/submit-your-code/index.html</link>

      <description>Sanity Check At this point, all autograding tests should be passing. To be sure, run all the tests at once and if any are failing, evaluate the error message and go back and fix your code.&#xA;How to Submit To turn in your assignment and get credit, follow the submission instructions .&#xA;Bonus Missions Here are some additional challenges, for those willing to take them on:&#xA;When we select a given field to search within and then submit, our choice is forgotten and returns to “All” by default.</description>
