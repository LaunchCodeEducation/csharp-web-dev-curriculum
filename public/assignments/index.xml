    <description>What is a Graded Assignment? Graded Assignments will count towards your final grade in the course. Each assignment is graded pass-fail. While Assignment 0 is more of a tutorial to get you used to autograding in C#, you have to get a passing grade on the four TechJobs assignments in order for you to continue on to the next unit. Each assignment builds on concepts introduced over multiple lessons, so we encourage you to begin reviewing the assignment and working on the different tasks as soon as the assignment becomes available in Canvas.</description>

      <description>Introduction Your first two tasks as an apprentice went well! You, Blake, and Sally built the TechJobs console prototype and then refactored the code to move it to an object-oriented format.&#xA;After demonstrating the prototype for the Company Team at LaunchCode, it received the green light to be fully built out as a web application.&#xA;The first step in this process will be to quickly develop a minimum viable product , or MVP.</description>

      <description>Your Task You will once again work with the TechJobs application. This time around you’ll add ORM functionality by using Entity Framework. You will be responsible for completing the code to allow users to create new job data. Your final application will have the same list and search capabilities as your Tech Jobs (MVC Edition) but you’ll need to do the work to connect the project to a database for storing user-submitted job data.</description>
