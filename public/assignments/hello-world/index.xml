      <title>Task 2: Running the Auto-grading Tests</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/hello-world/auto-grading-test/index.html</link>

      <description>We use unit tests in your graded-assignments to provide feedback on your progress. We will refer to them as auto-graded or auto-grading tests in these projects. Use the tests to check your work as you complete the assignment. The goal is to pass all tests.&#xA;Let’s learn how to run the tests in Visual Studio.&#xA;Each assignment will contain a test project. This project contains all of the auto-grading tests and may have more than one test class.</description>

      <title>Task 3: Start Coding</title>

      <description>According to the tests we just ran, we expected the string Hello, World! to be printed. Edit the code in the SayHelloClass class, within the SayHello() method to reflect this. Verify your code with the auto-grading tests.&#xA;Warning The auto-grading tests are VERY exacting. A difference of a single character will result in a failed test. The tests are also case-sensitive. You’ll need to pay attention to detail to correctly complete your assignments.</description>
