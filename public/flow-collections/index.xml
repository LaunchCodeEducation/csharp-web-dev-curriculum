      <description>Counting Characters In this studio, you will write a program to count the number of times each character occurs in a string and then print the results to the console&#xA;Getting Started Create your own project from scratch. Review Creating a C# Project if you need to.&#xA;Some Items to Ponder Before Coding There are multiple ways to approach this task, but one way involves the following steps:&#xA;Loop through the string one character at a time, Store and/or update the count for a given character using an appropriate data structure.</description>
