      <description>Many statically-typed programming languages provide a feature called enumeration types, or enum types for short. Enum types are special classes that can have only one of a set of fixed values, such as days of the week.&#xA;Imagine that we wanted to add a property to Event to specify which day of the week an event takes place.

We will take this approach in our CodingEvents application to categorize events based on their type, such as conference or meetup.&#xA;To follow along in CodingEvents, make sure that you have forked and cloned our repo . Your code at the beginning of this chaper should look like the viewmodels branch and at the end, your code should look like the enums branch.</description>
