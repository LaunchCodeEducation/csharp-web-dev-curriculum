    <title>Exercises: Razor Views :: C# Web Development</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/razor-views/exercises/index.html</link>
    <description>In this chapter, we started working on an application for tracking various coding events around town.&#xA;Getting Started Open up your CodingEvents project in Visual Studio. Create and checkout a new branch to complete these exercises.&#xA;The code you start with should roughly resemble this branch . If you have been coding along with the video lessons, you’re probably in good shape.&#xA;If you need a git refresher check out the resources in this chapter’s Next Steps As always, give the branch a useful name, like view-exercises.</description>
