    <description>Wouldn’t it be nice to have a small tracker to show us what programming skills we are working on? Let’s build something that would let us do just that!&#xA;As always, read through the whole studio before starting.&#xA;At the end of the studio, your final project should be able to take input from a user via a form and post the information in a way that is easy to read.</description>
