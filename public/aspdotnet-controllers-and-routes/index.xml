      <description>GET Request While reading the chapter, you created a basic Hello, World application using ASP.NET called HelloASPDotNET. Open that project up in Visual Studio, and get ready to add some features. Before you start working, create a new branch so you can revisit where you ended the reading at.&#xA;Modify your HelloController class to display a form on a GET request that asks the user for both their name and the language they would like to be greeted in.</description>

      <description>Wouldn’t it be nice to have a small tracker to show us what programming skills we are working on? Let’s build something that would let us do just that!&#xA;As always, read through the whole studio before starting.&#xA;At the end of the studio, your final project should be able to take input from a user via a form and post the information in a way that is easy to read.</description>
