## Next Steps

Adding in content to play around with. Mispelllllling a word.

The next chapter covers ViewModels. Before you continue your learning, if you need any additional resources on models and model binding, here are a few of our favorites:

1. [Overview of ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-7.0#model-binding)
1. [Add a Model to an ASP.NET Core MVC app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/adding-model?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio)
