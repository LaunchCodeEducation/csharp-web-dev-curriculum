To write a `List` version of the program, we will have to introduce several new C# concepts, including the class `List`. We will also review different kinds of `for` loops used in C#.

You will find the `ListGradebook` project in [csharp-web-dev-examples repo](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-examples).  Run the program, explore the code, and enter some grades.

```csharp{linenos=table}
List<string> students = new List<string>();
List<double> grades = new List<double>();
string newStudent;
string input;

Console.WriteLine("Enter your students (or ENTER to finish):");

// Get student names
do
{
   input = Console.ReadLine();
   newStudent = input;

   if (!Equals(newStudent, "")) {
      students.Add(newStudent);
   }

} while(!Equals(newStudent, ""));

// Get student grades
foreach (string student in students) {
   Console.WriteLine("Grade for " + student + ": ");
   input = Console.ReadLine();
   double grade = double.Parse(input);
   grades.Add(grade);
}

// Print class roster
Console.WriteLine("\nClass roster:");
double sum = 0.0;

for (int i = 0; i < students.Count; i++) {
   Console.WriteLine(students[i] + " (" + grades[i] + ")");
   sum += grades[i];
}

double avg = sum / students.Count;
Console.WriteLine("Average grade: " + avg);
```

Here we declare and initialize two objects, `students` and `grades`, which appear to be of type `List<string>` and `List<double>`, respectively. A list in C# is very similar to an array. Like an array, we must let the compiler know what kind of objects our list is going to contain. In the case of `students`, the list will contain values of type `string` (representing the names of the students), so we use the `List<string>` syntax to inform the compiler that we intend to fill our list with strings. Similarly, `grades` will hold exclusively values of type double and is declared to be of type `List<double>`.

In lines 1 and 2, we also initialize each `List` by creating a new, empty `List`. We could declare and initialize lists in one line like so:

```csharp
List<string> newList = new List<string> {"Apples", "Oranges", "Avocados"};
```
{{% notice blue "Note" "rocket" %}}
You will sometimes see the `List` class written as `List<T>`, where `T` represents a placeholder for the `type` that a programmer will declare a given `List` to hold. This is especially true in documentation. You can think of `T` as representing an arbitrary type.

Classes like `List<T>` that take another type or class as a parameter are referred to as **generic classes** or **generic types**.

## `List` Iteration
### `do-while`
We then use a `do-while` loop to collect the names of each of the students in the class.

```csharp{linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=9}
do
{
   newStudent = Console.ReadLine();

   if (!Equals(newStudent, "")) {
      students.Add(newStudent);
   }

} while(!Equals(newStudent, ""));
```

Recall that a `do-while` loop is very similar to a `while` loop, but the execution condition is checked at the end of the loop block. This has the net effect that the code block will always run at least once. In this example, we prompt the user for a name, which C# processes via `Console.ReadLine()` when the user hits the enter key. To finish entering names, the user enters a blank line.

{{% notice blue "Note" "rocket" %}} 
On lines 11 and 17, we use a method to compare the value of `newStudent` and `""`. The `Equals(a,b)` compares two strings, a and b, and returns true if the strings are the same. If the strings are not the same, the method returns false.
{{% /notice %}}

For each student that is entered (that is, each non-empty line), we add the new string to the end of our List with `students.Add(newStudent)`. The .`Add()` method is provided by the `List` Class. There are lots of other `List` methods to get familiar with, some of which we will discuss in more detail below.

### `foreach`
Below the `do-while` loop are two different loops that demonstrate two ways you can loop through a `List` in C#. Here’s the first, which collects the numeric grade for each student:

```csharp{linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=22}
// Get student grades
foreach (string student in students) {
   Console.WriteLine("Grade for " + student + ": ");
   string input = Console.ReadLine();
   double grade = double.Parse(input);
   grades.add(grade);
}
```

This, you may recall, is C#’s `foreach` loop syntax. You may read this in your head, or even aloud, as: `for each student in students`. As you might expect at this point, we must declare the iterator variable `student` with its data type.

## `for`
The next loop on display prints out each student’s name and grade:

```csharp{linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=31}
// Print class roster
Console.WriteLine("\nClass roster:");
double sum = 0.0;

for (int i = 0; i < students.Count; i++) {
   Console.WriteLine(students[i] + " (" + grades[i] + ")");
   sum += grades[i];
}
```

Here, we introduce the syntax `students.Count` which utilizes the `Count` property of `List`. This property holds the integer representing the number of items in the `List`. This is similar to string’s `.Length` property.

In this `for` loop, we use a loop index to define the starting point, ending point, and increment for iteration. It may be helpful for you to consider this kind of construction as something like, `for integer i in the range of the number of items in students...`. The first statement inside the parenthesis declares and initializes a loop index variable `i`. The second statement is a boolean expression that is our exit condition. In other words, we will keep looping as long as this expression evaluates to `true`. The third statement is used to increment the value of the loop index variable at the end of iteration through the loop.

Again, the syntax `i++` is C# shorthand for `i = i + 1`. C# also supports the shorthand `i--` to decrement the value of `i`. We can also write `i += 2` as shorthand for `i = i + 2`.

In the final lines of the program, we compute the average grade for all students:

```csharp{linenos=table,hl_lines=[],linenostart=40}
double avg = sum / students.Count;
Console.WriteLine("Average grade: " + avg);
```

## `List` Methods
Let’s gather up a few of the `List` methods that we’ve encountered so far, along with a few new ones. While these will be the most common methods and properties that you use with this class, they by no means represent a complete record. Refer to the [official documentation on the List class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netframework-4.8))for such a record, and for more details.

To demonstrate the use of these methods, we’ll create a new `List` called `planets`.

```csharp
List<string> planets = new List<string>();
```

Ok, we’ve got an empty List. We need to use the class’s .Add() method to populate this collection with items.

Using `.Add()` to populate `planets`:

```csharp
planets.Add("Mercury");
planets.Add("Venus");
planets.Add("Earth");
planets.Add("Mars");
planets.Add("Jupiter");
planets.Add("Saturn");
planets.Add("Uranus");
planets.Add("Neptune");
```

Thus, the first item in this table:

### List Methods in C#

{{% expand `IndexOf()` %}}
   Looks for an item in a `List`, returns the index of the first occurrence of the item if it exists, returns -1 otherwise.

   ```csharp
   planets.IndexOf("Jupiter");
   ```
   Returns `4` while
   ```csharp
   planets.IndexOf("Pluto");
   ```
   Returns `-1`.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand `Add()` %}}
   Adds an item to the List 

   ```csharp
   planets.Add("Pluto");
   ```
   adds `Pluto` to `planets`
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand `Contains()` %}}
   Checks to see if the `List` contains a given item, returning a `Boolean`.

   ```csharp
   planets.Contains("Earth"); 
   ```
   Returns `true`.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand `Sort()` %}}
   Rearranges the elements of a `List` into ascending order.

   ```csharp
   planets.Sort(); 
   ```
   Produces
   `{"Earth", "Jupiter", "Mars", "Mercury", "Neptune", "Pluto", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Venus"}`
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand `ToArray()` %}}
   Returns an `Array` containing the elements of the `List`
   ```csharp
   planets.ToArray();
   ```
   Returns
   `{"Earth", "Jupiter", "Mars", "Mercury", "Neptune", "Pluto", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Venus"}`
{{% /expand %}}







{{% notice blue "Example" "rocket" %}} 
In order to use `ToArray()`, we could first declare a `planetsArray` of the same size as `planets` or do it in one line of code.

```csharp{linenos=table}
// Option A
string[] planetsArray = new string[planets.Count];
planetsArray = planets.ToArray();

// Option B
string[] planetsArray = planets.ToArray();
```
{{% /notice %}}

In addition to these different methods we can use, the `List` class has a number of properties that are very helpful. You may find yourself using the `Count` property quite a bit. This property holds the number of values in the `List`. In our example, after we add all of the `planets` in the solar system, `planets.Count` has a value of `8` (unless you also added Pluto to planets, in which planets.Count returns 9).

Speaking of arrays, let’s see the array version of `Gradebook` next.
