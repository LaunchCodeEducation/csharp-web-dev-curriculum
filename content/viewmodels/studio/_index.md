We’ll build on the [user-signup-starter](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/SpaDayStudio6/tree/user-signup-starter) studio from last class, adding in model validation.

## Getting Started

Open up your SpaDay application and checkout the [user-validation](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/SpaDayStudio6/tree/user-validation) branch.

## Creating a New ViewModel

To get started with adding validation to our application, we need to first make a ViewModel. After adding a folder for storing our ViewModels, create a new ViewModel for working with form submission called `AddUserViewModel`. Add properties for the user’s username, password, and email. Also, add a new property called `VerifyPassword`.

## Add Validation Attributes

Navigate to `AddUserViewModel`. Add [validation attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations?view=net-6.0) to ensure these conditions are satisfied:

1. Username, password, and `VerifyPassword` are required.
1. Username is between 5 and 15 characters.
1. Email is optional.
1. If provided, the email has the format of a valid email address.
1. The password is between 6 and 20 characters.

Remember to add error messages to your attributes!


## Refactoring `UserController`

With our new ViewModel set up and ready, we need to refactor our action methods to make use of `AddUserViewModel`. 

Start by passing an instance of `AddUserViewModel` to `User/Add.cshtml` via our `Add()` action method. You may want to consider providing a route. This can make finding the new form easier as you work on this application.

Next, to refactor the `SubmitAddUserForm()` action method, we need to do the following:

1. Take in the instance of `AddUserViewModel` as a parameter.

1. Use `ModelState.IsValid` to make sure that the conditions outlined using validation attributes have been met.

1. If `ModelState.IsValid` is `true`, we want to double check that the value of `Password` is equal to `VerifyPassword`. If it is, we can create an instance of `User` and pass it to the `User/Index.cshtml` view. If the two passwords do not match, we need to reload the form with an error message displayed.

{{% notice green "Tip" "rocket" %}} 
We can pass an object and the name of a view to the `View()` method by using the following syntax:

```csharp
return View("ViewName", objectName);
```
{{% /notice %}}


### Validating That Passwords Match

Last studio, we added some validation checks to make sure the password fields match. Now we have two validation sections: one for the attribute-configured validation (which checks `ModelState.IsValid`), and one that checks that the password fields match. Make sure they work in-sync with each other to properly return to the form if any of the validation conditions fail.

{{% notice green "Tip" "rocket" %}} 

You can, in fact, validate that passwords match using attributes by taking a slightly different approach than we’ve done here. We outline how to do so in the [Bonus Mission section]({{< relref "#bonus-mission" >}}).  

{{% /notice %}}

## Refactoring the Views

The final step in adding ViewModels and validation to our `SpaDay` application is to refactor our views!

In `User/Index.cshtml`:

1. Make the `User` model accessible to the view.

1. Replace instances of `ViewBag` with the `@Model` syntax.

   {{% notice green "Tip" "rocket" %}}
   You may need to add the [null conditional operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#null-conditional-operators--and-) to `@Model` even if you declared the fields in the `User` model as nullable.  

   ```csharp
   @Model?.ValueName
   ```
   {{% /notice %}}

If we do this correctly, when a form with valid data is submitted, we should still see our personalized greeting!

In `User/Add.cshtml`:

1. Make `AddUserViewModel` accessible to the view.

1. Keep the `@if` statement up at the top so if the two passwords don’t match, we can see the error message.

1. Replace the inner contents of the form with a properly formatted form field for each property in the ViewModel. Each of your form fields should look something like this:

   ```html
   <div class="form-group">
      <label asp-for="PropertyName">PropertyName</label>
      <input asp-for="PropertyName" />
      <span asp-validation-for="PropertyName"></span>
   </div>
   ```




   {{% notice green "Tip" "rocket" %}} 

   When it comes to the password fields you may want to add a type attribute to the `<input>` tag for better data security!

   {{% /notice %}}


## Test, Test, Test!

You made a lot of changes! Be sure to thoroughly test them to make sure everything works as expected.


## Bonus Mission

Let’s set up our application so we can validate that the password fields match using attributes.

1. Add a `[Compare]` attribute to the `Password` property in `AddUserViewModel` to check if the value of `Password` is equal to the value of `VerifyPassword`.

   {{% notice blue "Note" "rocket" %}} 

   `[Compare]` can be used to validate that the values of two properties are equal. If the two values are not equal, you can add an optional `ErrorMessage` parameter with a helpful message (for example, “Passwords do not match.”) Here is an example of how this might look:

   ```csharp
   public string PropertyA { get; set; }

   [Compare("PropertyA", ErrorMessage = "The two properties must match!")]
   public string PropertyB { get; set; }
   ```

   {{% /notice %}}
   
1. Remove the `@if` statement from the top of the `User/Add.cshtml` form.

1. In the `SubmitAddUserForm()` method in `UserController`, `ModelState.IsValid` checks for if the validation conditions have been met. Now that we have added the validation attribute to the `Password` property, we can simplify our code so that we are not separately checking the password form fields against each other.
