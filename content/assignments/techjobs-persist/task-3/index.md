Using a many-to-many relationship, we can apply jobs to multiple skills, and a skill to multiple jobs.  We want to create a table that will track the relationships between both Jobs and Skills.  To do this, we need to tell the `Modelbuilder` which properties to use.  

## Update the `JobDbContext`

1. In the `OnModelCreating` method, we want to create a table called `“JobSkills”`.  This table will use an `Entity` of type `Job`.  It has many `Skills` with many `Jobs`.  It will use `Entity` to create a table named `”JobSkills”`.
1. Run a new migration and update your database to see your new table.

## Test It with SQL
Run your application and make sure you can create a new job with an employer and several skills. You should now also have restored full list and search capabilities.

### SQL Task: 
In `queries.sql` under “Task 3”, write a query to return a list of the skills that are attached to jobs in alphabetical order. If a skill does not have a job listed, it should not be included in the results of this query.

{{% notice green Tip "rocket" %}}
 You will need to make use of “is not null”.
{{% /notice %}}


{{% notice blue "Progress Check" "rocket" %}}
**Testing:** Run the tests found in `Task.Tests`.  These should all pass unless your database connections have been set incorrectly.

You will need to uncomment the code for the unit tests.  Look for `TODO` statements in lines 1 and 304 in the `DatabaseTesting.cs` in `Task.Tests`.

**Build:** You should have a working website that allows you to make a job, employer, and skill and connect them.  You should be able to see the connections in an the `Job/Detail` view.

**Database:** and see data in MySQL database.  You should see data in your `JobSkills` table.  It should be a pairing of Job and Skill Ids.
