   Before starting this task, un-comment out the tests in `TestTaskFour`.
{{% /notice %}}

Once you have your `Results()` action method passing information to the
view, you need to display the data.

1. In `Index.cshtml`, create a loop to display each job passed in from the
   controller.
1. Put the job results into a set of tables, similar to what you did for the
   `List/Jobs.cshtml` view.

Run the tests in `TestTaskFour` to make sure that you have passed everything properly to the view!
