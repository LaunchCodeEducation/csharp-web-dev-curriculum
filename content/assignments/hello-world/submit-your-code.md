## Stage and Commit

Once you pass all of the tests, `add`, `commit` and `push` your code to GitHub.

## Verify

Visit your assignment repository page to see the results of your submission. A green checkmark means the submission has successfully passed the tests. If you see a red X, then your submission is not yet correct. 

Continue working on your code until you have a green checkmark.

## Congrats!
