According to the tests we just ran, we expected the string `Hello, World!` to be printed. Edit the code in the `SayHelloClass` class, within the `SayHello()` method to reflect this. Verify your code with the auto-grading tests. 

  {{% notice orange "Warning" "rocket" %}}
   The auto-grading tests are VERY exacting. A difference of a single character will result in a failed test. The tests are also case-sensitive. You’ll need to pay attention to detail to correctly complete your assignments.
  {{% /notice %}}

### Recommended Resources for Debugging Code in Visual Studio

Visual Studio has a built-in Debugger feature to help you troubleshoot your code.  We will explore it more in later chapters.  However, if you want to read through the guides and try things out early, you may find that this is a wonderful tool and skill-set to develop.
