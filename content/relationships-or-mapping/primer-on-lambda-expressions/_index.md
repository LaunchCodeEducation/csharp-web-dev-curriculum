## A Primer on Lambda Expressions

Before diving into relationships in EF, we need to introduce a new concept.

A **lambda expression** is an *inline* function defined using the symbol ``=>``. 

This symbol is sometimes called a "fat arrow," and lambda expressions are sometimes called "fat arrow functions." The most basic syntax for creating a lambda expression is:

```C#
argument => return expression
```

The left-hand side of the expression consists of the arguments to be passed into the function, and the right-hand side states the return expression. There are more complicated ways to write a lambda expression, but we will only use this one.

Lambda expressions can seem confusing until you see them in action. We will look at some below.

### ``Select`` Example

The ``Select`` method for arrays can be used to create a new array with elements that are *transformations* of elements of an initial array.

{{% notice blue "Example" %}}
```C#
using System;
using System.Linq;

class MainClass {
    public static void Main (string[] args) {
    int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    var doubledNums = nums.Select(x => 2*x);
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", doubledNums));
    }
}
```

**Output**
```C#
2 4 6 8
```
{{% /notice %}}

Let's look at line 7 in more detail.

```C#
var doubledNums = nums.Select(x => 2*x);
```

The ``Select`` method takes a lambda expression as a parameter. 

The lambda expression is ``x => 2*x``. 

This is a function that takes a single element of the ``nums`` array, as represented by x on the left side of the expression, and returns the results of multiplying each of those array elements by 2. We can think of the execution of ``Select`` as follows:

1. ``Select`` begins by creating an empty array. This array will be returned at the end of the method.
1. It then loops over ``nums``.
1. Within the loop, each entry of ``nums`` is passed into the lambda expression.
1. The return value of the lambda expression is appended to the new array.
1. At the end of the loop, ``Select`` returns the new array of transformed values.

### ``Where`` Example

The array method ``Where`` can be used to *filter* elements of an array. In this case, ``Where`` takes a lambda expression that returns a boolean. If the boolean value is ``true`` then the value is included in the returned array. Otherwise, the value is NOT included in the returned array.

{{% notice blue "Example" %}}
Given an array of integers, we can use ``Where`` to filter out all of the odds, keeping only evens. Recall that a number ``x`` is even if ``x % 2`` is zero, and is odd otherwise.

```C#
using System;
using System.Linq;

class MainClass {
    public static void Main (string[] args) {
    int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        var evens = nums.Where(x => (x % 2 == 0));
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", evens));
    }
}
```

**Output**
```C#
2 4
```
{{% /notice %}}

In this example, the flow of execution of `Where` on line 7 is similar to that of `Select` above. The main difference is that instead of *transforming* every element of `nums`, it is filtered based on the lambda expression `x => (x % 2 == 0)`.

{{% notice blue " Note" %}}
While the examples we have given use arrays, the ``Select`` and ``Where`` methods work with most collection types. 

More generally, you'll find various specialized methods that use lambdas whenever you encounter a specialized collection type (such as `DbSet`, as we'll soon see).
{{% /notice %}}

### Check Your Understanding

{{% notice green "Question" %}}
Suppose you have an array of first names, `firstNames`, of people each with the last name Smith. What lambda expression would you pass to `Select` in the following code so that each name is appended by its surname?

```C#
var smiths = firstNames.Select(_______);

a. x => "Smith"
b. x => x + " Smith"
c. x => x + lastName
d. x => x == "Smith"
```
{{% /notice %}}
<!-- TODO: Add answer?: b. x => x + " Smith" -->

{{% notice green "Question" %}}
Given an array of numbers, ``nums``, what lambda expression would you pass to ``Where`` in the following code so that the resulting array consists of only the numbers greater than 42?

```C#
var bigNums = nums.Where(______);

a. x => x > 42
b. x => x == 42
c. x => 42
d. x => x < 42
```
{{% /notice %}}

<!-- TODO: Add answer?: x => x > 4 -->
